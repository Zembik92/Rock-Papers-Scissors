# Milestone 2
* From the website: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ 
* Populate samples of the four classes, rock, papers, scissors and nothing
* Train the model by following the instructions on the website 
* Then download the trained model as a h5 file and the labels as a txt file

# Milestone 3
* Create a conda environment, install pip then install the following libraries: opencv-python, tensorflow and ipykernel
* Check if your model is working by running testfile.py, ensure the model and lables file are in the same folder as testfile.py.

# Milestone 4
* Program a rock, paper, scissors game using the command line

# Milestone 5
* A rock, paper, scisors game that asks the user for input via video capturing, then predicts the gestures using a model created in teachable machine and compares the     results of the model to the random choice made by the computer.
* Display the gesture predicted by the model on the frame as text.
